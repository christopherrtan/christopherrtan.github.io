The goal of this WOD 5.1 was to use variables for displaying our used phone products instead of hard-coding everything so as to make it easier to manage.

Click <a href = "https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/050.variables_data_types/experience-SmartPhoneProducts1_variables.html">here</a> for WOD 5.1 instructions.

Compared to the prior WODs, Iʻve tried to do the instructions without watching the screencast solutions. I think that because of this, Iʻve been able to better understand and retain this WOD.

As of now, I think that keeping up this pace is important since itʻs only get harder from here. As such, I will continue reviewing the WODs beforehand until I am able to achieve a proficient understanding of the material that it is relating to.
