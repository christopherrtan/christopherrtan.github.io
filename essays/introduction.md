Hi! My nameʻs Christopher Tan and Iʻm planning on double majoring in Accounting and MIS. For some background, I was a computer science major for a semester. I was initially doing alright but I quickly fell behind due to the course being incredibly fast paced and highly self study driven. As such, I thought that MIS would be a good major to choose simply because it isnʻt as technical compared to computer science while being specific enough to use for business processes.
