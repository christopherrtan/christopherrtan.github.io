For BrowserHistory1, in total, it took me about an hour for the first time. I was mainly having issues making lists. Aside from that, I believe that I was able to quickly review and was able to add hyperlinks to words with ease. I think that I was able to complete this one a lot quicker since it was much more straightforward compared to 2 and 3 despite having more steps.

For BrowserHistory2, it took me about an hour and a half for the first time due to me being the most proficient with CSS. After doing a bit more researching on CSS syntax, I was able to complete the assignment much quicker than the first run

For BrowserHistory3, it took me almost two hours to complete this one. This one in my opinion was the most finicky. I was able to get the columns for the center and the right side but for some reason the left column was slightly raised. As such, I spent a full hour and a half trying to figure out why it looked messed up. Reason being that I had placed the ending tag (</div>) on the paragraph before the one I was supposed to.

In summary, I learned that coming in with a plan before doing these WODs and really taking the time to do your research reinforces the skills necessary to successfully complete these assignments.
